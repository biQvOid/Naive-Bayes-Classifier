Dusscusion about dogs and cats
The debate seems so never-ending when it comes to the subject as to which of the popular pets is a better
companion. And the rivalry will never cease today and for good. I guess it depends
on your personality, whether you are a dog or a cat person. Theres no consensus when it comes
to that, like the famous image of a perpetual quarrel between dogs and cats.
Generally, dog persons are reputed to be outgoing, dynamic and gregarious people, while
most cat people are seen to be quiet, gentle, sometimes retiring and aloof. But its not
always the case. People may surprise you about the choice of their pets which seems the opposite
of their own personality. Some people love both dogs and cats and own these pets. You may be
surprised that some dogs and cats are cohabiting peacefully under one roof.

Keeping a cat and a hamster in the same home isnt always easy. After all, these
two animals are natural enemies, and the chances of
your hamster surviving an attack from a cat are very low. Moreover, hamsters
fear cats, so they are likely to become stressed at the
mere sight of one.

Cats and Hamsters #2
Despite all that, cats and hamsters can live in the same house as long as you keep
them separated. Cats and hamsters dont get along
because hamsters are rodents, which cats instinctively hunt, torment, and kill. When
introducing the two pets, ensure that the cat
realizes the hamsters off-limits.

Most of all, you should not allow the cat and hamster to roam freely with each other. If one is out
of its cage, the other should be in its cage or another room. If both animals are out together, you
should have a second person holding or monitoring the cat while carrying the hamster.

Families that love dogs often love having other pets in the home. It is not uncommon
for family members to want their own pets to
enjoy. Many people choose to have a dog and a hamster.
Why not? They are both such fun to play with and pet. Our
dogs are affectionate, loving, and playful! What could go wrong?
Who does not enjoy watching a hamster running on his wheel or traveling
about his tubes? It may be wise to pause to consider that your adorable, busy
hamster might have a very different appeal to your curious canine. It may
be that your perfect pooch is just being friendly, but a slap with a paw or an affectionate
mouthing of the hamster could wind up in a fatal encounter for your hammie.

Dogs and Hamsters #2
If you want to enjoy both a dog and a hamster as pets together in the same home, you can do a number of things.
The first thing you need to do is to teach your dog to respect your hamster. First, you need to
consider if your dogs position is suitable to bring a hamster into the home.
After that, both the animals should be inspected well so that fleas and infections dont
spread from one to another. Be sure to introduce the animals to each other, avoiding any rush slowly.
It is advised to keep the dog on a leash and the hamster in a cage to avoid any untoward situation. Allow the
dog to sniff the hamsters scent for a few minutes, then take it out of the room.
This can be repeated three to five times a day. As the dog remains calm around the hamster, you can reward it.
Having a dog and a hamster at home can be pretty simple if you know the ropes and plan it well. So go out and get
your favorite pets and have a grand time.

Dogs behaviour
Dogs are carnivores, which means that they eat meat. Pet dogs eat dog food made with meat products. Wild dogs hunt animals.
Dogs claim territory and mark it as their own. They do this by urinating and rubbing their scent on things. But dogs also like to be
around people and other dogs. People can even train dogs to obey simple commands.

Hamsters
Hamsters info
Hamsters are rodents of the family Cricetidae. There are 25 hamster species.
The first known wild hamsters can be traced back to countries such as Syria, Belgium, portions of northern China, Greece, and Romania.
Hamsters are most common in dry, open habitats. They live in deserts, plains, sand dunes, steppes, shrublands, rocky foothills, river
valleys, agricultural fields, gardens, and orchards. Hamsters may be found at elevations up to 3,600 meters (11,800 feet).
Common pets throughout the world, hamsters are small, cute and readily available in the pet trade. These balls of fur are generally
friendly with people.

Hamsters
Hamsters desciribe
The five hamster species most commonly kept as pets are: Syrian, Roborovski, Campbells Dwarf, Chinese and Winter White Russian Dwarf
hamsters. Hamsters have a relatively short lifespan, about 2-4 years.
The various species of hamsters range in size from approximately 5 centimeters (2 inches) long to over
33 centimeters (13 inches). The most common pet hamster, the Syrian hamster, also known as the teddy bear
hamster or golden hamster, usually grows to about 13 to 18 centimeters (5 to 7 inches) long.
Hamsters have compact bodies, small, furry ears, short legs, wide feet, and short stubby tails.

Hamsters
Hamsters story
Their fur comes in a wide variety of colors and shades including white, black, yellow, brown, grey, or a mixture of these colors.
Most hamsters are strictly solitary.
In the wild, hamsters are more crepuscular (active in twilight) than nocturnal (active at night) and remain underground during the day
to avoid being caught by predators.
Hamsters are generally quick moving and have an amazing amount of stamina for a rodent, they run at 3-5 km/h (2-3 mph) for long periods
of time and 8-11 km/h (5-7 mph) for short distances.

The modern day domestic dog is a wonder of evolution. A passive, natural process shaped the psyche
of early dogs, where those that were friendly and helpful, were provided food, shelter or protection.

Dogs #3
Dogs have the largest range of size of any species of animal, from 2 pound Chihuahuas to 220 pound Mastiffs that stand between 6 and 42 
inches at the shoulder. Horses do have similar extremes of height, but they have nowhere near the diversity in skeletal variation.
The skull shapes present in the domestic dog are nearly as varied as the skulls that occur within the entire family of carnivores.
There are critical differences, from breed to breed, in craniofacial angle, which is the angle between the forehead and the jawline,
the mandible construction and how the jaw is joined to the skull, shape and position of eye sockets (orbits), and the angle and
structure of the junction between the skull and the neck.

Looking at an assortment of modern day dog skulls, a scientist would conclude that they are handling the bones of vastly
ifferent species, even a different genus, family, or order of animal. But these are all dogs, all the same species, all able to
interbreed (with a little help sometimes) and produce fertile young. For the casual observer, the length of the snout is the most
obvious variable. Short-nosed dogs are call brachycephalic breeds, and long-nosed dogs are called dolichocephalic breeds.

Millions of years ago, the earliest ancestors of all canids developed in North America, while the earliest ancestors of human beings
developed in Africa. But ancient wolves and ancient humans didn't meet until groups of both migrated to Europe and Asia.
While fossilized records of homo sapiens date back about 200,000 years, fossils that are clearly identified as dogs are only about 15,
000 years old. So it is suspected, but not proven, that the wolf ancestor of the dog was the first to begin living with humans, and
then evolved into the dog, but it is possible that the animals that were first tamed, were more dog than wolf.
Many of these questions are up for debate, but there is no doubt that a long time ago, a now extinct wolf-type or dog-like species, and
nomadic human beings, began to form a unique alliance. It is the parallel social structure of both humans and wolves that made the
union not only possible, but very successful.

There is a common myth that dogs dont like to make eye contact, or that looking directly at your dog is a threat.
Well, just like staring in human society, eye contact between dogs and humans comes in many forms, and is interpreted simultaneously
with the accompanying facial expression, body language, common knowledge and situation.
A stern, unbroken stare can, in fact, be a threat, or a show of dominance, but dogs and humans are also guilty of staring into
eachothers eyes and it is anything but unpleasant.

Most modern dogs have not practiced the trade for which they were developed for generations. Chances are, though your beagle was built
with droopy ears, a masterful nose, and a rollicking voice, he's never been on a fox hunt. Your Siberian husky has never pulled a sled,
and your wolfhound has never seen Russia, or a wolf.

But the natural inclinations that made them a good choice for a particular job, and the, in some instances, thousands of years of

Understanding what your dog was originally bred for, can help you choose the best dog for you, or at least help you to accept what you
cant change about the dog you already have. Breeds exist because dogs were specially selected and designed for different jobs, so,
generally speaking, a breeds original purpose - even if it was thousands of years ago - can have allot to do with the present day dogs 
behavior.

Undoubtedly the coolest of all cat facts, is that cats dont usually meow at other cats, just at humans! The charming and beautiful
domestic cat is one of the world's most common creatures, found in every corner of the planet, in numbers too vast to calculate.
They share a common ancestor with the African lion, and their fossilized and sometimes even mummified remains can be found entombed
alongside Kings and Pharaohs. But despite being ever present and all around us, even sharing our beds, they remain mysterious.

There are currently about 38 different species in the felid or cat family, from the magnificent 400 pound Siberian tiger, to the tiny
Rusty spotted cat, an Asian species which, at just 2 or 3 pounds, is the world's tiniest feline.
The domestic cat is usually between 6 and 20 pounds in weight, and their are approximately 45 different cat breeds recognized today,
from the tiny Singapura to the massive Maine Coon cat.
Cats are incredibly skilled hunters, and tend to be most active at dawn and dusk, when small birds and little rodents are out and
about. No degree of pampering or softening of lifestyle dulls the skill, and having a belly full of moist canned food, possibly
thoughtfully warmed up in the microwave, does not interfere with the cats prey drive. If they are allowed access to the outdoors, most
pet cats will hunt, or at least actively stalk small prey.
Cats are also notoriously bold, and have been seen taking on animals 10 or 20 times their size. Even young kittens have been observed
chasing off very large dogs, with the classic cat threat display.
Cats will stand up and walk on their hind legs, their front limbs spread out stiffly, claws unfurled, and wave their upper bodies
around as they growl. They can appear nearly twice their size by setting every hair on their bodies on end with the help of hundreds
of tiny muscles under the skin. They will arch their backs, snarl, hiss and spit in an attempt to confuse and disorient.

The cat is one of the most polarizing animals, inciting dread and disgust as equally as adoration and envy.
In ancient Egypt, cats were revered members of the family, and are depicted on wall murals playing underneath the diner table. If the
family cat passed away, the entire family would shave their eyebrows in mourning. The cat goddess Bastet was worshiped in temples, and
cats were mummified and buried with their owners.
Maneki-neko, the beckoning cat, is a symbol of good luck and prosperity in Japanese culture, and statues of the famous calico are
displayed in businesses and homes to summon wealth.
But in stories of black magic and witchcraft, the cat is an agent of darkness, and a companion to the witch, known as a familiar.
Familiars were usually thought to be tabby cats which were striped like tigers, not black cats, and some were even burned at the stake.
A horrible activity known as cat-burning was once seen as a form of entertainment in 16th century France. Kings, noblemen and even
Louis XIV was said to have set fire to a hanging wicker basket full of cats, while a crowd cheered. These rituals were usually followed
by a banquet.
Some seek concrete reasons for being cat-haters, like pointing to the cats tendency to play with their prey as a sign of evil, along
with their glowing eyes, and sneaky, night-time activities, but the love for cats is plain, as none can argue the recent rise of the
cat as an internet darling, being declared the worlds most viewed animal.

Cats were once thought to have been domesticated about 4,000 years ago in Egypt, but some new evidence suggests they were a part of our
lives as long ago as 9,500 years. So the dates have been moved back, but the question remains, are cats really domesticated?
The cat was domesticated from African wild cats in a process that began when human beings formed settlements and began farming. Grain
was stored in barns and silos in large quantities attracting hordes of rats, mice and other vermin. The wild cats controlled the rat
population, and were rewarded with additional meals, shelter, and eventually affection.

But, unlike the dog, which was domesticated some 40,000 years ago and is now significantly different both physically and
psychologically from its closest wild relatives, the domestic cat has changed very little through its 9,500 year-old partnership with
people. In fact, many domestic cats look almost identical to the wildcats that still roam Africa and Europe.

The cat is one of the worlds most excellent hunters, with each component of its body designed to support that function. Cats are
muscular, compact and sinewy, and they are almost exclusively carnivorous in the wild, your carrot-loving kitty not withstanding. They
will hunt anything that they can physically overpower, sometimes taking down animals, like jack rabbits and ground hogs, that are
nearly twice their size.
3
Cats
Cats #6
Their favorite prey are small birds and mice, which they sometimes trap between their claws, and toy with for awhile before actually
killing. Cats will also occasionally bring prey back to the house as a sort of present. These gifts may be dead or alive, and sometimes
arrive completely unharmed, as a testament to the cats amazing precision and skill.
11

Cats #7
They have excellent night vision, and their long whiskers and eyebrows allow them to feel their surroundings in the dark, and also
sense vibrations and even sounds.
The cats hearing is so strong it can recognize sounds that are both too high and too low for humans to hear. This comes in handy
because many of the rodents they enjoy hunting, also make very high-pitched noises.
They have long, sharp teeth, and razor sharp claws that retract like little switchblades. The claws retract to prevent them from
dulling, and to allow them to sneak up on prey. Mainly a tool for hunting, the claws are used in climbing as well.
Cats dont live in trees, and they rarely hunt in them, but they can climb them quickly, particularly when escaping from a larger
predator, namely a dog or a wolf. The cats claws are angled and curved in such a way that they can easily climb straight up the trunk
of a tree, but once up in a branch, the backward-curling claws make it difficult to get down.  Most cats figure out that backing down
is the safest way, but some will literally be stuck up a tree for days. If they fall out, another of their physical gifts clicks in,
the ability to right themselves in mid air.

Yet for all their killer hardware, the cat regularly overcomes its powerful instincts to retain a peaceful household. Cats and dogs get
along all the time, mainly because their centuries of living in domestication gives them the ability to suppress wild urges, or has
removed some impulses all together. And cats have made friends of all nature of potential prey, including rats, mice and parakeets.
Some well behaved buddies of household hamsters actually continue to hunt on their outdoor jaunts, somehow separating in their minds,
friend rat and foe rat - Fascinating!

Most folks who have cats in their lives will answer yes to that question, and recent scientific studies have actually collected data
that backs it up.
A cats brain actually reacts the same way chemically when it sees its owner, as the human brain does when looking at a child, a loved
one, or their cat.
The love hormone oxytocin, which is released in particularly large amounts when we first fall in love, increased in cats brains after
interaction with their owners by an average of 12%. So - proof cats love us!

The Syrian hamster is a lovely little rodent that can become quite tame, friendly and affectionate.
Also known as the golden hamster, the Syrian hamster is 5 to 7 inches long, and weighs between 4 and 8 ounces.
Native to Syria and Turkey, wild Syrian hamsters are a golden brown color with cream or white undersides.
This coloring is found in many domestic hamsters today, along with a wide assortment of new colors and patterns, some the result of
careful breeding.
Domestic Syrian hamsters may be solid white, black or red, pied with white patches, or dilute shades of blue and grey.

Attempts have been made to create a hamster with perfect panda markings, but it appears to be genetically tricky to produce the white

Long-haired Syrian hamsters have been bred with great success of course, and are called teddy bear hamsters.
A trademark of teddy bear hamsters is a long skirt of fur on either side of the little tail.
Male teddy bear hamsters tend to be much more fuzzy than females.

Adults range in size depending on the species. These rodents measure anywhere from about 2 inches, to 13 inches long. At their

These rodents come in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. Learn more about a few individual species and their unique traits,
below.
Golden– This species is one that people most commonly keep as pets. Wild individuals live only in small pockets of Syria and Turkey.
Though this might come as a surprise because they are so common in captivity, wild populations of this species are quite scarce. The
IUCN lists this species as Vulnerable due to habitat loss and agricultural expansion.
Campbells Dwarf – These little rodents bear the name of the person who originally collected the first scientific specimens. People
often keep this little creature as a pet. In the wild, this species lives in burrow systems.
Winter White Dwarf – Another common pet, this species is quite small with a distinct dark stripe down its back. Despite their name, pet
winter white dwarves do not typically turn white during the winter. This is because they live indoors and do not experience the change
of daylight length that triggers the white winter coat.
Roborovski Dwarf – Of household pet Hamsters, this species is the least common. They are tiny, but incredibly fast, making them
difficult to keep as pets. Their activity needs are much higher than some other species, and if they do not have enough active time to
explore their health suffers.

These little rodents occupy a variety of different habitats. However, many of them share the same types of preferences. Many species
live in relatively arid regions with low rainfall. Some common habitats include deserts and desert edges, steppe, rocky areas, plains

Depending on the species, some also range into agricultural areas. They live in pastures, fields, gardens, orchards, and more.

Humans might love Hamsters as cuddly little pets, but their wild counterparts face serious conflict with humans and human activity. 
Humans destroy their habitat to build homes and expand agriculture.
Farmers also trap or poison these rodents because they eat crops. Some species face direct risk of extinction in the wild, but most
have solid captive populations because of the pet trade.

So, you are the proud new owner of a cute and cuddly little puppy. Congratulations! But wait, you have other dogs at home too. So, how
do you introduce a new puppy to your furry family without turning your home into a chaotic, barking mess?
You will want to ensure the introduction process goes smoothly and that all your dogs can coexist peacefully.

As a new puppy owner, you may be thrilled to see your furry little companions romping and playing together. Still, its important to
remember that they must get used to each others presence before letting them interact too closely.
A gradual introduction is crucial for helping the puppies establish a positive relationship with each other. Start by allowing them to
sniff and get a sense of each others smells and sounds before letting them play. This will help them feel more comfortable with each
other and reduce the risk of accidental fights or injuries.
It may take some time for the puppies to get used to each other. Still, with patience and careful supervision, you can help them
develop a strong bond and enjoy playing together. Keep an eye on them and intervene to ensure a smooth and successful introduction.

Keeping the puppy on a leash during introductions to other dogs is an important safety measure to ensure everyone stays under control.
When introducing a new puppy to other dogs, keeping them on a leash to prevent any accidental fights or injuries is essential.
This is especially important if the puppy is tiny, as it may be more vulnerable to injury if a fight were to break out. Additionally,
if the other dogs are particularly boisterous or energetic, keeping the puppy on a leash can help prevent them from getting knocked
over or accidentally hurt.
Even if the other dogs are calm and well-behaved, keeping the puppy on a leash during introductions can help ensure everyone stays calm
and safe. In addition, keeping the puppy on a leash can help prevent accidents or injuries and ensure that the introduction process
goes smoothly.

When introducing a new puppy to other dogs at home, taking things slowly and giving them time to adjust is essential. One way to do
this is to introduce the puppy to the other dogs in separate rooms or areas. This allows them to get accustomed to each others
presence without being too close or overwhelming.
As they become more comfortable with each other, you can gradually increase their proximity and allow them to interact more closely.
This gradual approach can help prevent any initial aggression or fear that might occur if the dogs are thrown together too quickly.
Its essential to be patient and let the dogs take things at their own pace, as rushing the process can lead to problems later.
Following this gradual approach can help ensure that the introduction process goes smoothly and that your dogs can live happily
together.

During playtime, it is important to closely supervise the interactions between the puppy and the other dogs. This will allow you to
ensure that they are playing appropriately and not causing any harm to one another. You must intervene immediately to prevent accidents
or injuries if you notice any aggression or rough play.
This can be especially important if the puppy is very small or the other dogs are particularly boisterous. Additionally, keeping a
close eye on the dogs during playtime will allow you to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. Finally, you
can help ensure your dogs are happy and healthy by actively supervising playtime.

Rewarding good behavior during the introduction and playtime is important to encourage positive interactions between the puppy and the
other dogs.
By using treats and praise as rewards, you can reinforce good behavior and help the dogs learn to interact peacefully with each other.
This can be especially helpful if the puppy is very small or the other dogs are particularly boisterous.
Additionally, using treats and praise as rewards can help reduce anxiety and aggression in the puppy and the other dogs as they learn
to associate positive reinforcement with good behavior.
Overall, good rewarding behavior is a simple yet effective way to help your dogs learn to coexist peacefully and establish a positive
and harmonious relationship.

Crate training can be valuable when introducing a new puppy to other dogs at home. By providing the puppy with a secure and comfortable 
space, crate training can help alleviate anxiety and fear, making the introduction process smoother and more successful.
Additionally, the crate can be used to separate the puppy from the other dogs if necessary, helping to prevent any accidental fights or
injuries. This can be especially useful if the other dogs are particularly boisterous or if the puppy is very small and vulnerable.
Across-the-board crate training can be an effective way to help the puppy feel more secure and at ease in their new surroundings,
making it easier for them to adjust to living with other dogs.

Calming aids can effectively reduce anxiety and aggression in both puppies and adult dogs during the introduction process. Pheromone
diffusers release synthetic versions of the natural pheromones produced by dogs, which can help calm and relax them.
These diffusers can be placed in the room where the introductions are taking place or on the dogs collars to provide a more constant
calming effect.
On the other hand, calming supplements are usually given orally and contain ingredients like valerian root, L-theanine, and melatonin,
which have been shown to have a calming effect on dogs.
These supplements can be beneficial if the other dogs in the household are particularly anxious or aggressive, as they may be more
prone to reacting negatively to the presence of a new puppy.

If the introduction process between your new puppy and the other dogs in your household is not going smoothly, it may be helpful to
seek the assistance of a professional trainer or behaviorist.
These professionals have extensive knowledge and experience in helping dogs learn to get along and can provide valuable guidance and
support during the introduction process.
They can assess the behavior and temperament of your dogs and provide recommendations on how to best proceed with the introduction
process to ensure a safe and successful outcome.
They can also provide training and behavior modification techniques to help your dogs learn to coexist peacefully. In addition, they
can offer valuable support and guidance to you as the owner to help you navigate any challenges or concerns that may arise during the
introduction process.
All around, seeking the help of a professional trainer or behaviorist can be an invaluable resource in ensuring a safe and successful
introduction for all of your dogs.

A few nights ago, I woke up from a dead sleep to the sounds of a kitten.
Faint kitten meows.
We have cats, but they are grown cats, and this meow sound was definitely from a kitten, not a grown cat.
Worse, the faint meows sounded like the kitten was in distress.
They repeated over and over, meow — meow — meow.
Then the meows started to fade, getting weaker and weaker.
It sounded like they were coming from the window or outside.
I got up and checked the window - nothing.
I got dressed and went outside — nothing.
The meows had stopped.
I went back to bed.
Then I realized the sounds were coming from my CPAP machine.
After fiddling with the water tank and hoses. . . the kitten was rescued.

Kittens are completely dependent on their mother for their care for at least the first three to four weeks. They are born blind and 
wont open their eyes for at least a week, often as much as two.
They require stimulation from their mother to even urinate or defecate and have to either drink their mothers milk or appropriate 
kitten milk if they cannot access their mother.
This does mean that for the most part, you can leave the mother cat to do most of the work of taking care of her kittens. But there are 
a few things you can do to make it easier:

Make sure that the kittens and their mom have a safe, warm, and quiet place to nest and stay for at least the first few weeks of the
kittens lives. Clean up after them when needed and make sure theres nothing dangerous for the kittens to get into as they start
exploring.
Keep out other animals and younger children. Even the gentlest mother cat will defend her young and other people and animals can cause
the babies to feel stressed
Make sure the mom cat has access to high-quality food and plenty of water. She is burning a lot of energy right now!
As the kittens get older and start to explore, fully kitten proof their area – remove cords, pull out furniture they can hide in, make
sure they have access to toys, and dont let them play with things like curtain rods and strings or anything else that could become a
choking hazard. A room that is largely clear of furniture is best.

1-3 weeks of age: Eyes and ears open up. For the first week or so, kittens are both blind and deaf, but within three weeks, they can
hear well and start to see better, usually seeing blurry before hearing. Kitten eyes are always blue when they are born, but they can
change color as the kitten matures.
By three weeks of age, they can also start purring
3-5 weeks: Kittens start walking and by five weeks of age, are usually ready to start litter training. They will generally follow their 
mothers lead on that, but make sure the litter box is fully available and accessible to the kitten
6-8 weeks: By this point, you should definitely be socializing with your kitten by playing and cuddling gently, letting them explore
their surroundings while supervised, and introducing them to other pets and people. This is very important as it lays down a solid
foundation for socialization and creates more emotionally balanced adult cats. And who does not want to cuddle little puffs of fur?!
By this point, kittens should also have their first vet visit and get immunized for distemper, respiratory diseases, feline viral
rhinotracheitis and feline calicivirus.
By 12 weeks, kittens should get their rabies shots

As kittens mature, you will probably notice that they come in a whole range of colors, even ones that you dont see in the mom cat!
Whats going on?
Well, there are actually a few things going on: genetics being the primary one and how cats breed being the other one.
The main reason why a litter of kittens can come in such a massive range of colors is that the mother cat, or Queen, can be impregnated
by more than one male during an ovulation period. This is called heteropaternal superfecundation.

Each kitten in a litter could be sired by a different male and while it seems weird, it can actually happen in other mammals like dogs,
cows, and yes, humans. In the case of a queen cat being impregnated by a few different tomcats, you end up with several eggs being
fertilized by sperm from a few different sources which can result in kittens that all look different.
From an evolutionary standpoint, this method ensures that a mom cat will give birth to at least a few kittens. And since they all have
her genes in them, the coat color isnt going to matter much to her. Now as to where those colors come from when it comes to the
parents, in general, we can assume the following:

Kittens mature fast, so the window to make sure they are socialized is small – in the four to sixteen weeks of age! If it is left too
late, a kitten will be fearful of humans, fearful of other animals, and is more likely to go feral or get into trouble.
If you are able, socializing kittens as early as four weeks of age gives them the best start possible – if you are adopting a kitten,
starting as soon as you can is important, though hopefully some of the groundwork has already been done! Its important to be gentle
and patient with a kitten – remember, everything is brand new to them.All About Kittens
There are a few different ways you can socialize a kitten, all of them fun, none of them taking very long, though they should be done
regularly throughout the day:

Talk to your kitten so that they get used to voices
Play gently with your kittens using things like soft plush toys, feather wands, and laser points. This will not only burn off their
energy in a productive way but also teaches them that humans are fun
Gently dissuade them from biting and clawing skin by distracting them or using a spritz of water
If possible, get kittens used to children by letting children talk and play with them (carefully supervised!) This is an important
teaching moment for many kids too – they can learn to read when a cat has had enough playtime and what to do if they get scratched.
Introduce kittens to several different people you trust so that they get used to different people
You can also gently introduce kittens to other animals, under careful supervision, and in a neutral safe space. This includes dogs!
Cats that are introduced to dogs early in life are less likely to be afraid of them. When introducing your kitten to other pets, ensure
that every pet has their vaccinations up to date and take it slowly.
Snuggle your kittens gently so they get used to your scent (and the scent of other people) and get used to being handled. (Like we have
to tell you to snuggle kittens!)

Once your kittens are about ten to twelve weeks old, it may be time for them to head off to their new homes! Yes, we know you want to
keep them all, but thats a lot of cats.
When looking for new homes for your kittens, you should always take it slowly and carefully. You want to try to ensure that the kittens 
are going to good homes with people who will take care of them and are prepared for a long-term commitment.
If possible, you could even do home visits, but asking for video or photos of the home could work too (obviously minding any privacy
concerns). Ask potential owners about their experience with cats, which vet they would go through, what they know about cats, and what
type of cat they want in terms of personality and gender.
Invite potential owners to meet the kittens a few times and let everyone get to know each other. Ask them if they have other pets and
see if its possible to set up a meet and greet.
Remember, it is part of your job to make sure that the kittens go to homes where they will be safe, healthy, and thrive, so ask
questions, get to know the new owners a little, and give the kittens a chance to get to know them as well.
Finding people who want kittens is usually not a problem – finding the right people can take a little more time.

Cats vs Dogs #1
Everyone knows that cats and dogs typically dont get along. They are like Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy or Michelangelo and
Giovanni— some of the fiercest rivalries in history. Like these classic rivalries, dogs and cats have been at odds with each other for
many, many years. But like these bad bloods, whats the history behind cats and dogs?
While families love both cats and dogs, they have been pretty much-sworn enemies for as long as most people can remember or some say
approximately 12,000 years ago. Now naturally, people have tried to come up with reasons for the constant rivalry. But, while there are
plenty of speculations, determining the origin of the problem can be a tough pickle.
To some people, it has everything to do with cats being over independent. But to others, it has everything to do with dogs being
bullies. If we observe it though, the problem is not singlehandedly because cats are naturally feisty or that dogs have an inheren
reputation of being bullies. Rather, the two have a history dating back to before anyone can remember (1). A history that caused a rift 
in their relationship. Not to mention they have distinct personality traits. This blog post will help shed light on the history of cats
and dogs and why they became sworn enemies.

One of the most common questions asked is whether cats and dogs have ever coexisted harmoniously. The answer is a resounding yes. It
might not look like it now, but when cats were first domesticated, they have coexisted with dogs just fine. There is evidence that the
two lived together without any problem at all.
But, just as the two were starting to get along, cats were relegated to living outside. Whereas dogs lived a comfortable and fulfilling
life indoors, complete with dog beds, toys, and more. Of course, cats being naturally affectionate did not like living in the cold. So
they decided that they also wanted to share in the love and affection that the pups were getting. And so they domesticated themselves
onto their pet parents laps. A place that was best known for being the dogs territory.

Lets face it: cats and dogs are quite different. Dogs are to the most part social and playful whereas cats like to be independent. And 
while theres a common misconception that opposites attract, that isnt always the case. When it comes to dogs and cats, it is that
same difference that causes a strain in their relationship.
Another reason why dogs and cats dont typically get along is that they have different habits. And this has a lot to do with how they
are trained and bred for. Dogs are bred to hunt, and as such they love running around in a fenced-in yard or within the boundaries of
an invisible dog fence. They are taught to hunt and retrieve animals years ago and to this day, they still love chasing practically
anything that moves— specifically cats with wagging tails, although for most, this is just play. Now, while this may sound cute and
all, cats dont like the idea of being hunted. They are likely to take it as a threat and instinctively run away from their chaser.
